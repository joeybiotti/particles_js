# Particles.js

Found out about <a href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/">Particles.js</a> and wanted to try it out.

The end result is a (non functional) login page with a bunch of particles moving around in the background. The particles are responsive to click and hover. All of the particle controls are located in `particles.json`.
